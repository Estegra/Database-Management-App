# Database-Management-App

##Introduction

This app is a solo school project of mine which communicates with my database to maintain a graduate thesis system.
I have used .NET and MySQL to create this project.

In order to use the app user must create and populate the tables whose SQL queries are included.
Password for the database needs to be entered in "Password.json".
